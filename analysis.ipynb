I live with my brother and have no car payment or credit cards. I am in community college and work full time. Im going to use the money to make some repairs around the house and get some maintenance done on my car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Borrower added on 12/20/11 &gt; $1000 down only $4375 to go. Thanks to everyone that invested so far, looking forward to surprising my brother with the fixes around the house.&lt;br&gt;</td>\n      <td>other</td>\n      <td>Building my credit history.</td>\n      <td>774xx</td>\n      <td>TX</td>\n      <td>18.08</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>Sep-04</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>9279</td>\n      <td>36.50%</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>f</td>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n      <td>1476.190000</td>\n      <td>1469.34</td>\n      <td>673.48</td>\n      <td>533.42</td>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n      <td>269.29</td>\n      <td>2.52</td>\n      <td>Nov-12</td>\n      <td>121.45</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>Mar-13</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>INDIVIDUAL</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"
